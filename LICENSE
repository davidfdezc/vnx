# VNX is a general purpose open-source virtualization tool designed to help building 
# virtual network testbeds automatically. It allows the definition and automatic 
# deployment of network scenarios made of virtual machines of different types (Linux, 
# Windows, FreeBSD, Olive or Dynamips routers, etc) interconnected following a 
# user-defined topology, possibly connected to external networks.
#
# VNX has been developed by the Telematics Engineering Department (DIT) of the Technical 
# University of Madrid (UPM).
#
# VNX is a useful tool for testing network applications/services over complex testbeds 
# made of virtual nodes and networks, as well as for creating complex network laboratories 
# to allow students to interact with realistic network scenarios. As other similar tools 
# aimed to create virtual network scenarios (like GNS3, NetKit, MLN or Marionnet), VNX 
# provides a way to manage testbeds avoiding the investment and management complexity 
# needed to create them using real equipment.
