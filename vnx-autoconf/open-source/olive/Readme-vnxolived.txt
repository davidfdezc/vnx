VNX Olive autoconfiguration daemon (v0.1beta)
---------------------------------------------

vnxolived is an autoconfiguration and command execution daemon for Olive 
routers to work in VNX virtual scenarios. It is written as a basic 
shellscript (/bin/sh), because Olive routers, although based on a general 
Freebsd system, do not include bash, perl or other more advanced scripting 
options.
