1. Brief Description
--------------------
EDIV is an evolution of VNUML to allow the management of virtualization
scenarios deployed on multi-host distributed infrastructure. One of the
main design requirements is transparency, so users accustomed to use
basic VNUML (i.e. mono-host) will be able to work with EDIV in minutes.
